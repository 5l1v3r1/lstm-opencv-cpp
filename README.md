# Long short-term memory recurrent net
=====================

Bi-directional LSTM recurrent neural networks (C++ / OpenCV).

To run this code, you should have 

* OpenCV.

##Compile & Run
* Compile by running:
```
cmake .
make
```
* Run: 
```
./lstm
```
##Structure and Algorithm
See [my tech-blog](http://eric-yuan.me/rnn2-lstm/).

##UPDATES
* word2vec supported.
* bi-directional LSTM.
* CoNLL04 dataset support.
